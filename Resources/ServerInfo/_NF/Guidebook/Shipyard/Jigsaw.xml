  "First of a short-lived line of modular, tesselating vessels, the Jigsaw comes kitted for small salvage operations, and from the overbuild thrusters to easily removable walls and windows, is designed with user-modification foremost in mind."

  # Tips on running LVHI Jigsaw shuttles
  - Optimal Target Power (kW) for S.U.P.E.R.P.A.C.M.A.N. generator unit is 24 [bold]kW[/bold]. If you've added additional machines, check APC unit to see shuttle's power draw and adjust generator Target Power accordingly. For more general info on power grid see guidebook article [textlink="Power" link="Power"].
  - The fore of the ship has a salvage and ore processing area, with conveyors linked to the external balcony, allowing for easy reclamation and processing of building materials.
  - The windows of the shuttle indicate good areas to add annexes to, and the Jigsaw boasts additional thrust to make sure your modifications don't slow you down.
  - Make sure to consult the guidebook entry on [textlink="Expanding and Repairing Stations" link="ExpandingRepairingStation"] before you start knocking holes in the walls.
